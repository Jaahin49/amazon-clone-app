# amazon-clone-app

Live Project : https://amazon-clone-jaahin.netlify.app/

[N.B: The live link doesn't connect with the Cloud Firestore because of not having a Blaze account in firebase. So you may not process the order. But everything works fine in the localhostt]

 The Technology I've used here:
1 React [ Functional Component + Context API + Hooks + React Route]
2 Firebase (Authentication + Cloud Firestore + Deployment)
3 Payment Gateway (Stripe)
4 ES6 (map,reduce,arrow function, let/const, splice) + Material Ui + HTML + CSS
5 Dependency: react-currency-format
